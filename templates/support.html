                        <p><strong>What payment methods do you accept?</strong><br>We accept all major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover), as well as Vibe Pay, PayPal, and Apple Pay.</p>
                        <p><strong>Can I change or cancel my order after it's been placed?</strong><br>Once an order is placed, our fulfillment process begins immediately. You may be able to cancel within a very short window (usually 30 minutes). Please visit your Order Details page to see if cancellation is an option. We are unable to make changes to an order after it has been placed.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why was my credit card declined?</strong><br>A credit card can be declined for several reasons, including an incorrect billing address, insufficient funds, or a security block from your bank. Please double-check your information or contact your card issuer for more details.</p>
                        <p><strong>Do you charge sales tax?</strong><br>Yes, sales tax is calculated based on the shipping address and the items ordered, in accordance with local and state regulations.</p>
                        <p><strong>How do I view my order history?</strong><br>If you have an account, you can sign in and navigate to the "My Orders" section to see a complete history of your purchases.</p>
                        <p><strong>Can I use multiple payment methods on a single order?</strong><br>At this time, we can only accept one form of payment per order. However, you can use a Vibe Commerce gift card in combination with a credit card.</p>
                        <p><strong>Is my payment information secure?</strong><br>Absolutely. We use industry-standard SSL encryption to protect your details. Your payment information is transmitted securely and is not stored on our servers.</p>
                        <p><strong>Where can I find my invoice or receipt?</strong><br>A copy of your receipt is emailed to you after your order is confirmed. You can also find and print invoices from your "Order History" page if you have an account.</p>
                        <p><strong>What is a pre-authorization hold on my card?</strong><br>When you place an order, we place a temporary hold on your card for the total amount. This is not a charge, but a way to verify funds are available. The hold is removed and your card is actually charged only when your order ships.</p>
                        <p><strong>How do I apply a gift card to my order?</strong><br>During the checkout process, you will see a field to enter your gift card number and PIN. The amount will be deducted from your order total.</p>

                        <p><strong>What are your shipping options?</strong><br>We offer Standard (3-5 business days), Expedited (2 business days), and Express (1 business day) shipping options. Costs and availability vary by location.</p>
                        <p><strong>How can I track my order?</strong><br>Once your order ships, you will receive an email with a tracking number and a link to the carrier's website. You can also find tracking information in your Order Details page.</p>
                        <p><strong>When will my order ship?</strong><br>Orders are typically processed and shipped within 1-2 business days. You will receive a shipping confirmation email as soon as your order is on its way.</p>
                        <p><strong>Do you ship internationally?</strong><br>Currently, we only ship to addresses within the United States. We hope to offer international shipping in the future.</p>
                        <p><strong>Can I change my shipping address after placing an order?</strong><br>Unfortunately, we cannot change the shipping address once an order has been submitted. If the order cannot be delivered, it will be returned to our warehouse and you will be refunded.</p>
                        <p><strong>My tracking says "Delivered," but I haven't received my package. What should I do?</strong><br>Sometimes carriers mark packages as delivered prematurely. Please wait 24-48 hours. Also, check with neighbors or your building's mailroom. If it still hasn't arrived, please contact our support team.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why was my order split into multiple shipments?</strong><br>To get your items to you faster, we may ship them from different fulfillment centers. You will receive separate tracking numbers for each shipment at no additional cost.</p>
                        <p><strong>What are the shipping costs?</strong><br>Shipping costs are calculated at checkout based on the shipping method selected and the weight and dimensions of your items.</p>
                        <p><strong>Do you ship to P.O. Boxes or APO/FPO addresses?</strong><br>Yes, we ship to P.O. Boxes via our Standard shipping option. We also ship to APO/FPO addresses, though delivery times may be longer.</p>
                        <p><strong>What happens if an item is out of stock?</strong><br>If an item becomes unavailable after you've placed your order, we will notify you via email, cancel that item from your order, and issue a full refund for it.</p>

                        <p><strong>Do I need a receipt to make a return?</strong><br>For online orders, your order number serves as your receipt. You can find this in your confirmation email or order history.</p>
                        <p><strong>What if I received a damaged or incorrect item?</strong><br>We're so sorry for the trouble! Please contact our Customer Support team immediately with your order number and a photo of the issue, and we will make it right.</p>
                        <p><strong>Are there any items that cannot be returned?</strong><br>Yes, some items like gift cards, digital downloads, and final sale items are non-returnable. Please see our full return policy for a complete list.</p>

                        <p><strong>Can I return an online purchase to a physical store?</strong><br>Yes, you can return items purchased online at any Vibe Commerce store location. Please bring your order confirmation email with you.</p>
                        <p><strong>What if I lost my return label?</strong><br>No problem. You can reprint your return label by going back to your Order Details page and accessing the return information.</p>
