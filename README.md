# Vibe Commerce - A Vertex AI Search for Commerce Demo

Vibe Commerce is a fictional e-commerce site built to demonstrate the powerful capabilities of **[Google Cloud's Vertex AI Search for Commerce](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/vertex-ai-search-commerce)**. It's designed to illustrate how AI can create a modern, personalized, and intelligent shopping experience from the ground up.

This entire demo site was developed by a single developer with the assistance of **[Gemini Code Assist](https://codeassist.google/)**.

## Key Features

This demo highlights several core features of Vertex AI Search for Commerce:

*   **Site Search:** Experience fast, relevant, and intuitive search results that understand user intent, not just keywords. Includes rich features like faceting and query expansion.
*   **Product Recommendations:** Discover products tailored to your browsing history and preferences with "Recommended For You" carousels on the homepage.
*   **Conversational Commerce:** Engage with our AI-powered chat assistant to find products, ask questions, and receive guidance through natural language conversation.

## Inspiration

The design and spirit of this demo site are affectionately modeled after [Toys "R" Us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toys_%22R%22_Us), a beloved childhood toy store that was a cultural icon in the 1980s. This project aims to recapture a small piece of that nostalgic experience within a modern, AI-powered e-commerce framework.
